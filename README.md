# 🐦 Twitter Fingerprinting Project

Welcome to the Twitter Fingerprinting Project! This guide will help you understand the project and get it up and running in no time.

## 📖 Project Overview

The Twitter Fingerprinting Project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other advanced algorithms to analyze Twitter data. The goal is to create unique "fingerprints" for different Twitter users based on their tweet patterns, language use, and other behavioral metrics.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Here's a quick look at the project files:

- **/code**: Contains the main code files for the Twitter Fingerprinting project.
- **/data**: Datasets used for training and testing the models.
- **/models**: Pre-trained models and scripts for model training.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
- **/scripts**: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and other tasks.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining how to set up and use the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Twitter Fingerprinting project up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, download the project files. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedHashim27/Twitter-Fingerprinting.git
cd Twitter-Fingerprinting
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install the Required Packages
Install the necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Project
Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root directory. Add the necessary configuration settings, such as your Twitter API keys.

### 5. Run the Application
Start the application using `gunicorn`:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 your_project_name.wsgi
```

Replace `your_project_name` with the actual name of your Django project.

## 🧠 Algorithms and Techniques

This project leverages several advanced algorithms and techniques, including:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used for text analysis, sentiment analysis, and language modeling. The `tf` function calculates term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for tweet content to measure the importance of words in tweets.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Various algorithms are used for classification and clustering of Twitter data. The project uses similarity measures to compare tweet content, posting times, and media to identify similar accounts.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization are used to prepare the data for analysis.
