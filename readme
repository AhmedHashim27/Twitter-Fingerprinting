the methods of detecting similar accounts depend on first obtaining a group of accounts to measure the percentage of similarity between them. Here, it depends on two methods. The first is to measure the similarity between a list of accounts for which the similarity is calculated only, and the second method depends on only one account, so all activities performed by this account are analyzed, whether from following people, tweeting some texts, or sharing some media. By this information and the geo-location information, if available, a list of unfinished accounts can be analyzed, where two operations are done here in parallel, and the first is to search for all accounts that do the same activities, such as publishing similar texts, following some people, publishing some media, etc. This process is done continuously and every time a new account appears, the percentage of similarity between this account and the main account is calculated. Accordingly, all accounts linked to this account can be obtained and they are automatically updated.
To find out the similarity between the accounts, it rely on three basic criteria, namely TF-IDF, Time Activity Frequencies analysis and Media Similarity. where the system analyzes all the tweets made by this account and compares the texts in it with other accounts. And then get the pictures in the tweets and calculate the differences between the pictures and based on it it can be clarified whether the same pictures are published on the same accounts or close and the last criterion is the period of tweeting the accounts and its repetition over different time periods and the convergence of the distribution of these times increases the possibility of similarity of these accounts.
